### How To Play

In our Version of the game, the winner is the first player to reach 10 points.

- The highest valued card wins the hand
- Values: "Ace is high", "2" is low.
- in the event of a tie, both players now flip 2 cards..
- - The second card now determines the winner of the tie.
- - This is repeated until there is no longer a tie.
- - The winner of the tie takes all the cards flipped since the last "capture".
- Each card "captured" counts as 1 point.
- First Player/Computer to reach or surpass 10 points Wins !

### License

### What would we do in a version 2 ?

- More likely: we will build completely New Projects to keep learning and applying new skills.

- extend game play until one player captures all 52 cards.
           (This could easily make for a Very long game.)
- properly transfer the winning cards to the player that wins the hand. 
 - - in the current version, this was not necessary because we have a winner far before all cards are looked at. Easy to implement this change.
- - game would then end when the player or computer runs out of cards.

- update the visual layout, adding some animated effects showing a transfer of cards, or shuffling, for example

- make a two player version of the game
